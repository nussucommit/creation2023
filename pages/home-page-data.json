      "title": "A Digitalised Omnipresent IT Support Experience",
      "description": "Create a poster to promote use of self-help channels for IT services.  The theme of the poster is to encourage staff and students to use self-help channels such as ALCA (chatbot), nTouch (self-help IT portal) and IT Care website.  Using self-help means no more queueing (get help immediately without waiting) and getting answers anytime anywhere (no time or physical boundaries) – this brings convenience to our staff and students, and enable them to be more efficient in their work and studies.   The design should also promote awareness of the new IT Care website that has been revamped to allow staff and students to find self-help resources easily. The poster should have a modern look and gives off warm and friendly vibes.",

Your poster should include relevant research data and eye catching visuals that support the delivery of the message. Your poster should revolve around the general theme of mental health, especially for students.",
